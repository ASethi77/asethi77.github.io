If you're building PCBs at home, you may want to keep an inventory of common components
like resistors, capacitors, etc. at hand so you're not constantly waiting on parts.

This page covers some of the basic parts you might want to keep on hand, along with part
spreadsheets you can import into DigiKey for fast ordering.

## Resistors

I'd recommend keeping a good chunk of the E6 series around, plus some 0-ohm resistors to
jumper configuration pins.
