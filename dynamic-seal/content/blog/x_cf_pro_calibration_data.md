This page will be an assortment of random calibration data for my 3d printer because I'm too lazy to get the g code for each of my slicers perfectly lined up.

## Printer Z Offset (via the touchscreen button)

### For prints made by QIDI print

**Z Offset**: -0.02mm
**As Of**: 7/4/2024

### For prints made by OrcaSlicer

**Z Offset**: +0.08mm
**As Of**: 8/20/2024

## Retraction

### Hatchbox PETG

#### For prints made by QIDI print

**Distance**: 6mm
**Speed**: 50mm/s
**As Of**: 7/4/2024
**Notes**: Maybe this can be improved? Looked good with OrcaSlicer but later tests (8/20/2024) with a different PETG mfr. show stringing @ 6mm distance

#### For prints made by OrcaSlicer

**Distance**: 4.2mm -> 5mm all seem acceptable
**Speed**: 50mm/s
**As Of**: 8/20/2024
**Notes**: None
