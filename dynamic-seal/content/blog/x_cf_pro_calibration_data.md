This page will be an assortment of random calibration data for my 3d printer because I'm too lazy to get the g code for each of my slicers perfectly lined up.

## Printer Z Offset (via the touchscreen button)

### For prints made by QIDI print

z offset = -0.02mm

### For prints made by OrcaSlicer

z offset = +0.08mm
