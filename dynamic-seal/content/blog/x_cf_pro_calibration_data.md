This page will be an assortment of random calibration data for my 3d printer because I'm too lazy to get the g code for each of my slicers perfectly lined up.

## Printer Z Offset (via the touchscreen button)

## Hatchbox PETG

### For prints made by QIDI print

**Z Offset**: -0.02mm  
**As Of**: 7/4/2024  

## Sunlu PETG

### For prints made by QIDI print

**Z Offset**: 0mm (!!!!) ðŸ˜„  
**As Of**: 8/21/2024  
**Notes**: Z offset was adjusted via full leveling process and a 0.15mm feeler gauge @ 85c.  

## Retraction

### Hatchbox PETG

#### For prints made by QIDI print

**Distance**: 6mm  
**Speed**: 50mm/s  
**As Of**: 7/4/2024  
**Notes**: Maybe this can be improved? Looked good with OrcaSlicer but later tests (8/20/2024) with a different PETG mfr. show stringing @ 6mm distance  

#### For prints made by OrcaSlicer

**Distance**: 4.2mm -> 5mm all seem acceptable  
**Speed**: 50mm/s  
**As Of**: 8/20/2024  
**Notes**: None  

## Nozzle distance to bed

**Distance**: 0.15mm  
**Notes**: Measured using a feeler gauge. Bed leveling performed @ 85c for PETG (edges of bed are substantially cooler)
